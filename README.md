# defuse division zylang's cheat
now since there is no cheat right now on defuse division and i don't want to reverse engineer the game right now here some universal script that kind of work, the esp 1 it has full esp settings and i don't blame it, the esp 2 if you want a simple esp and it doesn't work the first one, the hitbox expander is op but you need to set it sometimes since it's kind of broken after a round so you need to reload it everytime (put a keybind for it), and the spec script the same i putted the keybind to open and close it whit INSERT but the first time you need to click that and then reclick it and it should work, if it doesn't reload it. The hitbox expander script will broke also my script since there are 2 rayfield menu so it delete mine so if you want to use mine script after the hitbox just load again mine script
